Inheritance is a process in object oriented programming in which objects acquire (or inherit) the properties of objects of another class. It is therefore used to create relationships between one object and another. Each class groups together objects of a similar type, with similar properties. New classes can be formed by this process whose objects will have properties of both the classes from which this new class is formed. A superclass has all of the properties of the subclasses below it. At the same time subclasses are each distinctive from each other but related via the superclass. Subclasses are said to ‘extend’ superclasses. Due to these relationships, object oriented programmes tend to be easier to modify since they do not need to be changed when a new object, with different properties is added. Instead, a new object is made to inherit properties of objects which already exist. Inheritance can be divided into two main processes: single inheritance and multiple inheritance. Single inheritance means that the class can only inherit from one other class, whereas multiple inheritance allows for inheritance from several classes.\\n',\n",

       " 'taskd_g4pD.txt': 'Bayes\\' Theorem is a simple mathematical formula used for calculating conditional probabilities. Bayes\\' Theorem is a theorem of probability theory originally stated by the Reverend Thomas Bayes. It figures prominently in subjectivist or Bayesian approaches to epistemology, statistics, and inductive logic. It can be seen as a way of understanding how the probability that a theory is true is affected by a new piece of evidence. It has been used in a wide variety of contexts, ranging from marine biology to the development of \"Bayesian\" spam blockers for email systems. In the philosophy of science, it has been used to try to clarify the relationship between theory and evidence. Many insights in the philosophy of science involving confirmation, falsification, the relation between science and pseudosience, and other topics can be made more precise, and sometimes extended or corrected, by using Bayes\\' Theorem. Subjectivists, who maintain that rational belief is governed by the laws of probability, lean heavily on conditional probabilities in their theories of evidence and their models of empirical learning. Bayes\\' Theorem is central to these enterprises both because it simplifies the calculation of conditional probabilities and because it clarifies significant features of subjectivist position. Indeed, the Theorem\\'s central insight  that a hypothesis is confirmed by any body of data that its truth renders probable  is the cornerstone of all subjectivist methodology. ',\n",
